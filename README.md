# AI07_Project_4-Semantic-Segmentation-for-cell-neuclei
This project show how to do semantic segmentation by taking the images of cell neuclei as the example.
You can find the image data from the [Release](https://github.com/ChernXi/Project_4_Semantic_Segmentation/releases), and follow the code to see how it was done.
I wrote the code using the environment of google colab. If you were to run it in your local machine, you'll need to modify the code a little bit. 

Below are some samples of images and masks(labels) that used for training:
