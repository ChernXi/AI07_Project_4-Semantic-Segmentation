# Project-4-Semantic-Segmentation for cell neuclei
This project show how to do semantic segmentation by taking the images of cell neuclei as the example.
You can find the image data in the attach file, and follow the code to see how it was done.
I write the code using the environment of google colab, if you were to run it in your local machine, you'll need to modify the code a liitle bit.
